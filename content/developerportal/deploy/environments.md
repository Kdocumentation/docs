There are also four actions you can perform, which are described below.

#### 2.1.1 Creating a Package from Team Server

In this section, you can click **Create a Package from Team Server** and select a branch containing the revision you would like to build.

Only branches where the latest revision is Mendix 5 and above will be displayed here. If you need to build other revisions, please do so manually from the Mendix Modeler.

#### 2.1.2 Uploading

When you click **Upload**, you can upload an *.mda* file from your local device.

#### 2.1.3 Viewing the Details of the Deployment Package

Next to the deployment package info, if you click **Details**, the following items will be displayed:

* Size of the package
* Description of the package
* A build output
* An overview of the environments that are currently running on this deployment package

**Actions**

There are also two action you can perform:

* Download the package
* Delete the package

#### 2.1.4 Deploying a Deployment Package

If you click **Deploy**, the package from the team server will be transported to the environment that you select to upload.

### 2.2 Environments

#### 2.2.1 Standard Licensed Environments

![](attachments/environments/deploy-environments.png)

In this section, you have the an overview of all the available environments with the following details:

* Environment name
* Environment status
* Name of the deployment package
* The version of the deployment package
* Runtime (the Modeler version)
* The URL of the app

There are three types of environment statuses:

*   Green – there are no alerts
*   Orange – there is at least one warning alert, but no critical alerts
*   Red – there is at least one critical alert

{{% alert type="info" %}}
The environment status is cached; there can be a delay of up to five minutes before the status icon displays a change of status.
{{% /alert %}}

To see the details of the alerts, click **Alerts** under the **Operate** category. This is documented here: [Alerts](/developerportal/operate/monitoring-application-health).

**Actions**

There are two actions you can take :

* **Details** of the selected environment – information about the details available are documented here: [Details](environments-details)

* **Transport to ...** – initiates the staging of an environment to the next stage: acceptance or production

#### 2.2.2 Flexible Environments

If your node supports flexible environments you will see a slightly different format for the list of environments.

![](attachments/environments/deploy-flex-environments.png)

This shows a similar list of details (the differences are highlighted):

* Environment status
* Environment name
* **PROD** will be checked if this environment is a production environment (this is set when the environment is first created)
* Name and version of the deployment package
* Runtime (the Modeler version)
* **PLAN** indicates the plan for this environment - you can see more information about the plan on the *Details* page.
* The URL of the app

**Reordering Environments**



**Actions**

For flexible environments there is only one action you can take :

* **Details** of the selected environment – information about the details available are documented here: [Details](environments-details)

There is no concept of staging, and you need to deploy your app directly to the target environment.

{{% /alert %}}

## 3 Custom Domain

In this tab you can manage your custom domain certificates on an application level.

When your Mendix app needs to be accessible via your own URL (for example, `https://myapp.mycompany.com/`), you have to provide a custom domain certificate (an SSL/TLS certificate) so that we can keep serving your Mendix app via a secure connection.

There is also a section with an overview of linked custom domains.

For more information, see [Custom Domains](custom-domains).

## 4 Access Restriction Profiles

In this tab you can manage custom access restriction profiles. These profiles can combine IP range filters and client certificate verification. Access restriction profiles can be applied to path-based access restrictions in specific environments of the application.
